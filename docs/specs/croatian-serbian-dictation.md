# Croatian and Serbian dictation

Delivery spec for [#359](https://github.com/brittain9/speech-kit-obsidian-plugin/issues/359), which asks for Croatian and
Serbian dictation through Whisper. This is also the first language request
handled under [adding-a-product-language.md](adding-a-product-language.md), so it
carries the one-time refactor that makes later requests cheap.

## Decision

Croatian (`hr`) and Serbian (`sr`) are separate product choices; neither is a
proxy for the other, nor for Bosnian or Montenegrin. Their matrices are very
different, and that difference is the whole reason the tier system exists.

|                   | Batch (Whisper LV3T) | Live (Nemotron) | Read aloud (Supertonic) | UI         | en→      | →en           |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------- |
| **Hrvatski** `hr` | ✅                   | ✅ prompt 29    | ✅                      | ✅         | deferred | ❌ unreleased |
| **Српски** `sr`   | ✅                   | ❌ absent       | ❌ absent               | ❌ by rule | deferred | ❌ unreleased |

**Croatian is a Full-tier language** — every speech capability we ship covers
it, so it also earns a UI catalog. **Serbian is Dictation tier**: batch
transcription, nothing else in speech, English interface.

Every cell was checked against the pinned artifact, not inferred:

- **Nemotron** — the pinned `processor_config.json` (`f3d3333`)
  `prompt_dictionary` has `hr` and `hr-HR` at index **29**, and no `sr`,
  `sr-RS`, or `bs` at all. It _does_ carry `sl`, `sk`, and `bg`, which is why
  "Nemotron supports Slavic languages" is not a usable claim.
- **Whisper** — the language map carries both `hr` and `sr` on the multilingual
  artifacts. `.en` artifacts are unaffected.
- **Supertonic 3** — the model card lists 31 languages including `hr`. `sr` is
  absent, as are `bs` and `sr-Latn`; the adapter must reject Serbian rather than
  fall through to its `na` branch.
- **Firefox Translations** — `en-hr` and `en-sr` both have `releaseStatus:
  "Release"` (`base-memory`, ~31.6 MB each). `hr-en` and `sr-en` exist **only**
  as `tiny` builds with no release status, so neither language enters the
  catalog's bidirectional English-anchored set.
- **Obsidian locales** — `hr` is listed work-in-progress, `sr` complete. Both
  are selectable app languages, so a plugin catalog for either would work; the
  cost is authoring it and finding a native reviewer, not platform support.

### The Serbo-Croatian translation model

The `en-hr`, `en-sr`, and `en-bs` Release models are all exports of the same
`hbs-topk10` training run — `hbs` being the ISO 639-3 code for the
Serbo-Croatian macrolanguage. Mozilla trained one model and published it under
three tags.

This is worth knowing before promising anything: our stated policy is that we do
not serve one language from another's model, and here the upstream vendor has
effectively done that for us. Adding both `en→hr` and `en→sr` means shipping the
same weights twice under two names, and it is unclear without testing whether
the `en-sr` export produces Cyrillic, Latin, or whatever the input suggests.
Ship at most one direction from this family until someone has looked at real
output.

## The refactor this unblocks

`native/src/transcription.rs:9` defines one eight-tag constant,
`VERIFIED_MULTILINGUAL_LANGUAGE_TAGS`, that four unrelated consumers read:

| Consumer              | What it uses the list for                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `catalog.rs:229`      | validating `languageTags` on every catalog model           |
| `catalog.rs:379`      | validating `translationSupport` and direction packs        |
| `whisper.rs:42,106`   | Whisper's advertised support **and** its runtime rejection |
| `nemotron_asr.rs:134` | Nemotron's advertised support                              |

So adding `hr` and `sr` to it would simultaneously claim Serbian live dictation
and permit a Serbian translation pair. There is no way to add one language to
one engine.

Split it by responsibility:

1. Rename to `PRODUCT_LANGUAGE_TAGS` and narrow it to what it is actually good
   at — the vocabulary of tags the product can persist and that catalog entries
   may name. Keep both catalog validation call sites. Add `hr` and `sr`.
2. Give Whisper its own list in `whisper.rs`, covering the eight plus `hr` and
   `sr`, used by both `verified_multilingual_language_support()` and the
   rejection path at line 106.
3. Make Nemotron derive its `LanguageSupport` from `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGE_PROMPTS`,
   which is already the authoritative mapping. Delete the test at
   `nemotron_asr.rs:1699` asserting the prompt table equals the global list —
   that assertion _is_ the coupling, and it will fail correctly the moment
   Croatian lands.

Supertonic already owns its list (`supertonic.rs:24`) and needs no structural
change.

After this, "which languages does model X serve?" has exactly one answer per
model, and no edit can make an engine claim a language its artifact cannot
serve. That property is what the rest of the playbook depends on.

## Scope

Following the recipe in [adding-a-product-language.md](adding-a-product-language.md):

- **2a** `PRODUCT_LANGUAGE_TAGS` gains `hr`, `sr`.
- **2b** `DICTATION_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS` gains `Hrvatski` / `hr` and `Српски` /
  `sr`.
- **2c** Whisper's list and `whisper_large_v3_turbo_q8_0.languageTags` gain both.
- **2d** Nemotron gains one `LanguagePrompt { product_tag: "hr", metadata_key:
  "hr-HR", index: 29 }`; `nemotron_asr_0_6b_int8_streaming_560ms.languageTags`
  gains `hr` only.
- **2e** Supertonic's `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and
  `supertonic_3_multilingual_2026_05.languageTags` gain `hr` only. `sr` must be
  rejected explicitly rather than falling through to the `na` branch in
  `preprocess_text`.
- **2f** No translation pairs — see [Translation and UI](#translation-and-ui).
- **2g** `src/locales/hr.ts` plus its `catalogs` registration, shipped
  separately so it never blocks the speech work. No `sr.ts`.
- **3** FLEURS fixtures for `hr_hr` and `sr_rs` at sentence 1577.
- **4** README claims split into interface / translation / dictation counts.

Preflight is the part worth reviewing carefully. With `sr` selected, the model
picker must show Whisper as the only eligible engine, and choosing live
dictation or read aloud must explain the gap _before_ capture or playback
starts. Silent English fallback is the failure mode this whole design exists to
prevent.

## Translation and UI

Neither blocks the speech work above. Together they are what stands between
Croatian and a complete Full-tier claim.

**Translation — decided: skip.** Only the `en→` directions are released, and
Croatian and Serbian translation is deferred until Mozilla releases the reverse.

The reasoning is worth keeping. Shipping one-way would have meant ~32 MB per
direction added to a pack every user downloads regardless of the languages they
translate, a UI that has to explain a missing reverse, and a fix to
`isSupportedTranslationPair` (`src/translation/languages.ts:44`) so the product
layer stops approving English-anchored pairs the installed pack cannot serve.
The alternative — the unreleased `tiny` builds — is a different architecture
from anything currently shipped and would need its own evaluation against
`docs/quality/translation-model-comparison.md` before it could be promised.

Neither cost is worth paying to half-deliver a capability. Every translation
language works both ways today; that invariant is worth more than a partial
Croatian entry, and Croatian is already Full-tier on speech without it.

Revisit when `hr-en` or `sr-en` reaches `Release` in the registry. Catalog-driven
translation-direction validation is useful, but it is a separate behavior
change and stays outside this language PR.

**UI localization — Croatian yes, Serbian no.** This follows [the localization
rule](adding-a-product-language.md#the-localization-rule): full speech coverage
earns a catalog.

Croatian has batch, live, and read aloud, so `src/locales/hr.ts` is in scope.
Serbian has only transcription. Obsidian ships a complete `sr` app locale and a
catalog would be technically selectable, so this is a deliberate product call
rather than a platform limit: localizing the whole interface around a feature
set that mostly reports "not available with your installed models" advertises
capability the product does not have. English is the honest presentation, and
Serbian dictation still works.

The Croatian catalog shipped in a follow-up PR, so the speech work never waited
on it — a Full-tier language with no catalog is a normal state. It is authored
the same way the existing seven were (D7 in
[ui-localization.md](ui-localization.md)): drafted in full, then reviewed
independently against English for meaning, grammar, register, and terminology.
That process is not a substitute for native sign-off, which remains open. What
it rules out is the actual failure mode — pasting raw machine-translation output
into a locale nobody has read.

## Serbian script

Serbian is written in both Cyrillic and Latin. The requester answered the open
question in [#359](https://github.com/brittain9/speech-kit-obsidian-plugin/issues/359):
Cyrillic should be the default because it is the country's official script.
The product therefore exposes one Serbian option labeled `Српски` and keeps
the canonical `sr` tag. The Cyrillic label already communicates the script;
there is no redundant qualifier, script selector, or second Latin option.

Whisper has no script parameter, but it does support an initial prompt. Explicit
Serbian requests receive a short Serbian Cyrillic prefix before decoding. This
steers the model toward Cyrillic directly while preserving names and acronyms;
the product does not rewrite the transcript afterward.

Blind Latin-to-Cyrillic conversion is deliberately avoided. Cyrillic-to-Latin
is deterministic, but the reverse direction is context-sensitive: Latin `nj`,
`lj`, and `dž` sometimes represent one Cyrillic letter and sometimes two. The
quality gate therefore checks recognition independently and requires at least
80% of alphabetic output from manually selected Serbian to be Cyrillic.
Automatic detection remains script-neutral because the language is not known
when its prompt would need to be selected.

## Acceptance

- [x] No shared constant can make an engine claim a language it cannot serve;
  the Nemotron equality test is gone and its support derives from the prompt
  table.
- [x] `hr` and `sr` persist as distinct choices with endonym labels; Serbian is
  explicitly Cyrillic and has no second script option.
- [x] Whisper transcribes both, with pinned FLEURS fixtures at sentence 1577.
  Native review still outstanding.
- [x] Nemotron accepts `hr` at index 29 and rejects `sr` before audio capture.
- [x] Supertonic reads Croatian aloud and rejects `sr` explicitly — read aloud
  refuses a language the selected voice model does not declare rather than
  falling through to the language-neutral `na` branch.
- [x] Translation UI remains unchanged and offers neither Croatian nor Serbian.
- [x] The eight existing languages are unchanged.
- [x] Settings shows what the selected language actually covers, so Serbian
  users learn the shape of their support without hitting a failure.
- [x] README states three separate capability counts, not one.
- [x] `npm run check` green, less `biome check .` — twelve stale worktrees under
  `.worktree/` carry nested configs that abort the run; scoped
  `biome check src test scripts` is clean.
- [ ] `multilingual-quality` dispatched and linked; native review recorded in
  `docs/quality/`. Needs the branch pushed first.
- [x] Support matrix in the playbook updated.

## Non-goals

- Any new ASR, TTS, or translation runtime.
- Serbian live dictation or read aloud — no shipped model serves them, and one
  request is not a business case for finding one.
- A Serbian UI catalog, now or later, unless Serbian gains those capabilities.
- Bosnian or Montenegrin, despite `hbs` making them nearly free on the
  translation side. Nobody asked, and free is not a reason.
- A blanket "all Whisper languages" setting. The point of the tier system is
  that each language carries verified evidence.
