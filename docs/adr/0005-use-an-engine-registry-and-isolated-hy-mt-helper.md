# Use a translation-engine registry and isolated HY-MT helper

Translation is exposed through stable engine IDs rather than through a generic model selector. Firefox Translations remains the backward-compatible fast, literal default and continues to run in a plugin Web Worker. Tencent HY-MT is an optional natural, paraphrastic engine covering its documented 38 languages all-to-all; unsupported Firefox pairs automatically use HY-MT.

The saved engine is a preference only while its compatible model remains installed. If it is unavailable and another compatible translation engine is installed, the installed engine becomes the persisted default. Installing an additional engine does not replace an already usable preference, while removing the preferred engine falls back to a remaining compatible installation.

HY-MT inference runs in a version-matched helper shipped beside every sidecar. The main sidecar launches that exact sibling path and supervises bounded framed stdin/stdout, cancellation, shutdown, and a five-minute idle lifetime. Keeping llama.cpp in the helper avoids the Whisper/llama.cpp GGML symbol collision without adding a user-installed service, localhost API, or `PATH` dependency. The model itself remains a direct, explicit, hash-verified upstream download and is not redistributed.

The plugin owns a controller-level translation job, so closing the preview only detaches the view. One active Natural inference is allowed; the status bar reopens it, explicit Cancel aborts it, and completed output stays recoverable until applied, dismissed, or replaced.
