### Local Dictation 2026.6.10

First — thank you for 225+ downloads! Genuinely awesome to see people using this.

For anyone new: Local Dictation is private speech-to-text for Obsidian. You talk, it types into your note, and transcription runs 100% on your machine — no accounts, no cloud, no telemetry.

This update is about what happens after transcription: cleaning up raw dictation with an LLM. Until now that was local-only through Ollama. Now you can also route cleanup through OpenRouter for access to frontier models — and the new Auto mode means you don't have to think about it: everyday dictations stay on your machine, and only long transcripts that would hang on a local model go to the cloud.

What's new:

- Local / Remote / Auto routing for LLM cleanup — Ollama on-device, OpenRouter remote, Auto picks by transcript size
- Remote kill switch — one toggle guarantees no transcript ever leaves your device
- Searchable OpenRouter model picker — with live price tiers (Free / $–$$$$) so cost is visible before you pick
- Preset manager — create, edit, duplicate, or delete your own cleanup presets alongside the built-ins
- Presets can add instead of replace — TLDR puts a summary above your untouched transcript; a new Action items preset appends a checklist
- Plus security hardening, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

On privacy: local is in the name for a reason. Transcription never leaves your device, and LLM features are optional and off by default. Want remote? OpenRouter supports zero data retention (ZDR) endpoints, and a one-click test button verifies your key and model end to end.

### Local Dictation — live dictation is here

Talk into your Obsidian notes and watch the words land. Local Dictation is private, on-device speech-to-text: no accounts, no cloud, nothing leaves your machine.

What's new

- Live dictation — new Moonshine streaming models show words as you speak and finalize on a pause. Tiny, Small, and Medium; Small is the sweet spot.
- Three top model families, all local — Whisper, Cohere Transcribe, and Moonshine, on CPU or GPU.
- Clearer model picker — settings now show which models dictate live vs. transcribe after a pause.
- More reliable & responsive — streaming finalization is more accurate and stays smooth through long dictation.

Plus on-device speaker labels, system-audio capture, and optional local LLM cleanup.

Get it: Obsidian → Settings → Community Plugins → search "Local Dictation". https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/local-dictation https://github.com/brittain9/local-dictation-obsidian-plugin

### Local Dictation 2026.7.4 is out — private, offline speech-to-text for Obsidian

Dictate notes or transcribe entire meetings 100% locally — nothing ever leaves your machine. Local Whisper transcription with speaker labels, timestamps, and optional AI cleanup. No subscription, no API key, no cloud.

What's new in 2026.7.4:

✨ Try dictation right from setup — finish the wizard and jump straight into a real dictation session. Zero to talking-to-your-vault in one click.

📌 Dictation stays in the right note — browse your vault mid-dictation and your transcript keeps landing exactly where you started it.

🛡️ Safer, smarter recovery — clearer guidance when something goes wrong, and if a note changes underneath an active session, dictation now stops safely instead of writing to the wrong spot.

If you've been meaning to try voice notes or meeting transcription without shipping your audio to someone else's server, now's a great time:

### Local Dictation 2026.7.6 is out

Speech-to-text that runs 100% on your device — no cloud, no API keys, nothing leaves your vault.

Why people pick it up:

🔒 Fully local & private — choose from top models run on-device, offline
⚡ Live dictation — words appear as you speak and refine in place, Apple-Dictation style
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meeting capture — record system audio alongside your mic, with automatic speaker labels and timestamps

New in this release:

- Never lose a sentence — new commands reinsert your last utterance or restore the raw transcript if an AI cleanup mangles it
- Better timestamps — drop them in every few minutes, at each sentence, or at paragraph breaks
- Cap speaker labels — tell diarization how many speakers to expect (1–8) so it stops inventing extras
- Plus general fixes and stability improvements across settings, live transcription, and microphone handling

### Local Dictation is now multilingual 🌍

Local Dictation turns your speech into text right inside Obsidian — running entirely on your machine. The latest release adds the biggest feature yet:

🗣️ Dictate in 8 languages — English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and Japanese via Whisper Large V3 Turbo. Pick your language or let it auto-detect.
⚡ Live multilingual dictation with the new NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 ASR engine, which streams text as you speak in any of the eight languages.
🎯 No guesswork — settings only offer languages your installed model's weights actually support.
📊 Every language is certified against real human speech recordings before release, and the full quality report (per-language error rates, latency, streaming responsiveness) is public: https://github.com/brittain9/local-dictation-obsidian-plugin/blob/main/docs/quality/multilingual-quality-report.md

Why I built it this way:

- Completely free and MIT-licensed — no accounts, no credit cards, no API keys. Install, click a few buttons, start talking.
- Works offline. Everything runs locally and your voice never leaves your machine — no per-hour API costs, no audio sitting on someone's server.
- Cross-platform, with the same experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- The engine is built in — no cloud API to configure, no self-hosted endpoint to babysit. Models install from a catalog inside settings, and dictation, meeting transcription, and cleanup all live where your notes already are.
- Optional AI cleanup with your own OpenRouter key, stored in Obsidian's Secret Storage instead of plain-text settings.

Next up: localizing the plugin's UI itself into all eight languages.

**Reactions:** 2 “Nice” reactions.

### Local Dictation: natural, private text-to-speech is here

Local Dictation can now read your Obsidian notes aloud with Pocket TTS - with natural, non-robotic speech that runs 100% locally on your device.

There are no usage fees, no text sent to a cloud service, and no internet connection required after downloading a model. Your notes stay private, and TTS is free to use.

The new experience is deliberately command-first:

- Bind Local Dictation: Read aloud to any hotkey.
- Select text to read only that selection, or run the command with nothing selected to read the full note.
- While reading, compact controls appear for the model, voice, speed, pause/resume, and stop - without adding more ribbon clutter.
- Choose local models and voices, with pitch-preserving playback speeds from 0.75× to 2×.

Dedicated Pocket TTS models are available for English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.

I chose Pocket TTS first because its voices have more natural prosody and sound less robotic than lightweight alternatives such as Supertonic.

Supertonic is planned as a future option for 31-language coverage and faster synthesis on lower-powered CPUs.

Get Local Dictation from the [Obsidian Community Plugins directory](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=local-dictation).

You can also see the full [2026.7.11 release on GitHub](https://github.com/brittain9/local-dictation-obsidian-plugin/releases/tag/2026.7.11).

Please reach out with bugs and feature requests - especially what you'd like to see more of in future releases:

- More languages
- Local Translation
- More TTS models and voices
- Deeper Obsidian integration

Try it and let me know what would make local read-aloud more helpful for accessibility in your workflow.

### Local Dictation 2026.7.12

Speak into your notes, and have your notes speak back to you — all locally on your device and 100% free.

What's new

🔊 Local Dictation now supports Supertonic 3 for fast, lightweight text-to-speech that runs efficiently on your CPU — no GPU or cloud service required.

Supertonic 3 supports 31 languages, with eight currently available in Local Dictation: English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and Japanese. It also includes 10 built-in voices.

This release also includes general stability fixes, performance improvements, smoother model installation and recovery, improved CUDA setup, and security fixes.

### Local Dictation is now Speech Kit

🎙️ Local Dictation is now Speech Kit
The speech and language toolkit for Obsidian

Local Dictation has grown beyond dictation. Speech Kit brings tools that are usually split across separate apps into one place inside the note editor you already use.

🎤 Dictate directly into your notes
📝 Transcribe meetings, calls, and recordings
🌍 Translate text across eight languages
🔊 Listen to notes with natural voices

New in 2026.7.13: Translate notes locally

Translate selections or entire notes between English and Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and Japanese. Preview the result before changing your note, then continue working offline with translation running on your device.

Why Speech Kit?

🧩 One toolkit inside your notes for dictation, meeting transcription, translation, and read aloud
💻 Cross-platform on desktop with the same workflow on macOS, Windows, and Linux
🔄 Choose your models freely without being tied to one engine or API
🔒 Everything runs on your device so your work stays private and continues working offline

If you already use Local Dictation, your settings, hotkeys, and installed models carry over automatically.

🎙️ **Speech Kit 2026.8.1: turn your voice into a clipboard**

Thank you for 1,000 downloads. This release adds an OpenAI-compatible LLM provider requested by a community member, along with a new voice clipboard workflow.

For anyone new, Speech Kit (formerly Local Dictation) is a free speech and language toolkit for Obsidian. Dictate into notes, transcribe meetings, translate text, and listen to notes using models that run on your own device.

📋 **Speak in Obsidian, paste anywhere**

The new voice clipboard automatically copies each completed phrase while Speech Kit keeps listening. You can dictate in Obsidian, then paste directly into an email, chat, document, form, or any other app without stopping to select and copy text.

If you use optional writing cleanup, your words are copied immediately and the clipboard updates with the polished version when it is ready. Just speak, let Speech Kit clean it up, and paste the finished result wherever you need it.

🧠 **Connect your own language model**

Speech Kit can now connect to OpenAI-compatible providers such as LM Studio. This means you can use a local or self-hosted language model to clean up rough dictation while keeping control over the provider and model you use.

🔒 Speech recognition still runs locally on your computer. Writing cleanup is optional and only uses the provider you configure.

Try it out and let me know what you would like to see next.

🌍 Speech Kit just got a huge translation upgrade

Speech Kit turns Obsidian into a private, local-first language workspace. You can dictate your thoughts, transcribe meetings, listen to your notes, and now translate them with a genuinely powerful multilingual model.

This release adds Tencent HY-MT, bringing natural, fluent translation across 38 languages directly into Obsidian.

Instead of stiff, word-for-word output, the new Natural translation mode is designed for real writing. It produces smoother prose that feels much closer to something a person would actually write.

✨ Translate entire notes or selected text
🌎 Translate between any two supported languages
✏️ Edit the result before adding it to your note
⚡ Choose between Fast & literal and Natural & fluent
🔒 Keep your notes private with translation running locally on your computer
📴 Continue translating offline after setup

This is one of the biggest Speech Kit releases yet, and it makes Obsidian dramatically more useful for multilingual writing, research, language learning, and international work.

If you support open-source, private AI tools, please star the GitHub repository. It genuinely helps more people discover the project:

🎧 **Speech Kit 2026.8.6: hear it, follow it, refine it**

Speech Kit (formerly Local Dictation) is the speech and language toolkit for Obsidian. Dictate ideas, transcribe recordings, translate your writing, and listen to your notes—using models that run on your own computer.

This release makes read aloud and translation work together more naturally.

✨ **Follow along as Speech Kit reads**
Turn on spoken-text highlighting to see a subtle underline move through the sentence currently being read. It keeps your editor and selection untouched, so you can stay oriented without disrupting your note.

🌍 **Listen to translation previews**
Finished translations now have a Read aloud button. Hear the result in its target language before you replace, insert, or copy it into your note.

⚙️ **Use the translation model already on your computer**
Speech Kit now chooses a compatible installed translation style for the language pair you selected, and makes unavailable options clear instead of sending you toward the wrong model.

🔒 Everything stays local and continues working offline once your models are installed.

🌍 **Speech Kit 2026.8.7: a serious upgrade for private translation**

### Top-tier translation quality, completely local

Speech Kit now supports **Tencent HY-MT 2**, one of the strongest open translation model families you can run on your own computer. It was built specifically for fluent, real-world multilingual work instead of being a general chatbot repurposed for translation.

It has the performance to back that up. In Tencent's published evaluations, the compact **1.8B** model outperformed Microsoft and Doubao commercial translation APIs overall, while **7B** outperformed open models far larger than itself.

### Private translation, right inside Obsidian

Translate a selection or an entire note, review and edit the result, then apply it when you are ready. Speech Kit exposes **38 language options**, and everything runs locally after setup. There is no account, no API key, and no sending your notes to a translation service.

### Choose the version that fits your computer

- ⚡ **HY-MT 2 1.8B · 1.13 GB** - fast, efficient, and the best choice for most computers.
- 🧠 **HY-MT 2 7B · 4.62 GB** - more capacity for users who want to push local translation further.

### Your models, easier to manage

Have an older model downloaded? You can now **open the model folder** to view your models or manage the files directly.

✨ **Coming next:** translation style controls for HY-MT 2, giving you more say over how your translations sound.

If Speech Kit sounds useful, give the project a star on GitHub. It helps more Obsidian users find it.

🎙️ **Speech Kit 2026.9.1: a small translation and maintenance update**

Thank you for 3,000 downloads! I really appreciate everyone trying Speech Kit in their vaults and sharing feedback.

This is a small release with a few useful improvements:

🌍 **More translation languages on demand** — choose from the expanded Firefox translation catalog and download only the language pair you need.

🔊 **Separate read-aloud language** — choose the language Speech Kit should use when reading your notes aloud.

⚙️ **Performance, security, and reliability improvements** — updated dependencies and a handful of behind-the-scenes fixes keep the plugin running smoothly.

Everything remains local and works offline after setup.

## September 26, 2026 — draft for 2026.9.3

**Reactions:** Not yet posted.

🎙️ **Speech Kit 2026.9.3: turn videos and recordings into notes**

Speech Kit started with live dictation: a reliable way to capture long sessions in Obsidian with high-quality speech models you choose. This update brings that workflow to audio and video you already have.

Paste a YouTube link and Speech Kit brings the video's available captions into your note. Choose **Transcript only**, or pick one of your AI presets before you start. In a couple of clicks, you can turn a long video or podcast into a summary, outline, or whatever your own prompt calls for. Use a local AI model or a provider you configure with your own API key. With my OpenRouter setup, summaries have cost me a few cents per video; the actual cost depends on the model and transcript length.

You can also drop in an audio or video file and transcribe it locally with an installed speech model. Choose timestamps, speaker labels, and formatting for that recording, then optionally run an AI preset on the complete transcript. The media file stays on your computer.

I've wanted an easy way to turn talks, interviews, and podcasts into notes I'll actually use. Try it and tell me what you make with it—or what you'd like improved next. If Speech Kit is useful to you, a GitHub star helps other Obsidian users find the project.
