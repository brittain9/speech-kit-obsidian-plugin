# Third-Party Notices

Speech Kit embeds or downloads the following model artifacts so speech
processing works offline. Downloaded catalog artifacts are verified against
pinned sizes and SHA-256 hashes before activation.

## Tencent HY-MT 2 and llama.cpp

Translation uses a packaged helper built from llama.cpp through the
version-pinned `llama-cpp-2` Rust binding. llama.cpp and llama-cpp-2 are
licensed under the MIT license (llama-cpp-2 also offers Apache-2.0).

The optional Tencent HY-MT 2 models are not distributed in plugin or sidecar
archives. When the user chooses Install, a selected Q4_K_M model is downloaded
directly from the pinned upstream Tencent repository. The models are licensed
under Apache-2.0; retain Tencent's upstream attribution and notices:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hy-MT2/71928c82b61fc04e0289ad7eab1faf5ebef721b2/LICENSE.txt

No endorsement by Tencent, llama.cpp, or llama-cpp-2 contributors is implied.

The model artifacts are downloaded only when the user installs the catalog
model. The Linux sidecar archive contains the verified official FunASR helper,
plus sherpa-onnx and ONNX Runtime shared libraries required for the online
Paraformer pass. These components are not covered by this project's MIT
license. No endorsement by FunASR, ModelScope, sherpa-onnx, ONNX Runtime, or
llama.cpp contributors is implied.

## NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 ASR streaming model

- Work: `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b`
- NVIDIA checkpoint revision: `f3d333391852ba876df169dcc9ba902d25b6ab0b`
- Derived 560 ms int8 ONNX export revision:
  `ab43d895f5985b1bbab8b6eac8607fcdc05343f3`
- Export implementation: sherpa-onnx
  (`f71d85ff2f07422014f55fa89cb083fa52cce71f`, merged as
  `6a204636c4b8d97b45e8c4ab4a22e0067162b637`)
- License: OpenMDW License Agreement, version 1.1 (OpenMDW-1.1)
- Canonical agreement: https://openmdw.ai/license/1-1/

The catalog downloads the derived ONNX encoder, decoder, joiner, and tokenizer
directly from the pinned export repository. The model and derived weights are
not MIT-licensed. The ONNX conversion and int8 quantization modify the original
NVIDIA checkpoint's packaging and numerical representation.

### OpenMDW License Agreement, version 1.1 (OpenMDW-1.1)

By exercising rights granted to you under this agreement, you accept and agree
to its terms.

As used in this agreement, "Model Materials" means the materials provided to
you under this agreement, consisting of: (1) one or more machine learning
models (including architecture and parameters); and (2) all related artifacts
(including associated data, documentation and software) that are provided to
you hereunder.

Subject to your compliance with this agreement, permission is hereby granted,
free of charge, to deal in the Model Materials without restriction, including
under all copyright, patent, database, and trade secret rights included or
embodied therein.

If you distribute any portion of the Model Materials, you shall retain in your
distribution (1) a copy of this agreement, and (2) all copyright notices and
other notices of origin included in the Model Materials that are applicable to
your distribution.

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against any
person or entity asserting that the Model Materials directly or indirectly
infringe any patent or copyright, then all rights and grants made to you
hereunder are terminated, unless that lawsuit was in response to a
corresponding lawsuit first brought against you.

This agreement does not impose any restrictions or obligations with respect to
any use, modification, or sharing of any outputs generated by using the Model
Materials.

THE MODEL MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT,

APPLY TO THE MODEL MATERIALS OR ANY USE THEREOF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
ANY PERSON'S COPYRIGHTS OR OTHER RIGHTS INCLUDED OR EMBODIED IN THE MODEL
MATERIALS; (2) OBTAINING ANY NECESSARY CONSENTS, PERMISSIONS OR OTHER RIGHTS
REQUIRED FOR ANY USE OF THE MODEL MATERIALS; OR (3) PERFORMING ANY DUE
DILIGENCE OR UNDERTAKING ANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MODEL MATERIALS OR
ANYTHING INCORPORATED OR EMBODIED THEREIN.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROVIDERS OF THE MODEL MATERIALS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,

  https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

The Nemotron adapter's native Rust graph orchestration and feature frontend
follow these reference implementations' published behavior. No NeMo or
kaldi-native-fbank binary is linked or bundled by the Nemotron adapter. The
separate FunASR hybrid path does link and bundle sherpa-onnx as described
above.

## Pocket TTS read-aloud models

- Work: Pocket TTS
- Creator: Kyutai
- Model and voice-state source:
  https://huggingface.co/kyutai/pocket-tts-without-voice-cloning/tree/e041936c75475d350b405bc870bcf7c22da4e9e6
- Derived INT8 ONNX export:
  https://huggingface.co/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx/tree/58a6d00cf13d239b6748cb0769f35c580a8f606c
- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

The model catalog downloads selected Pocket TTS graphs and voice embeddings on
demand for English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian read
aloud. The derived artifacts convert and quantize the original weights to INT8
ONNX, changing their packaging and numerical representation. They are not
covered by this project's MIT license. No endorsement by Kyutai or the ONNX
export author is implied.

## Supertonic 3 read-aloud model

- Work: Supertonic 3
- Creator: Supertone
- Model, ONNX graph, and voice-style source:
  https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3/tree/3cadd1ee6394adea1bd021217a0e650ede09a323
- License: OpenRAIL-M
  https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3/blob/3cadd1ee6394adea1bd021217a0e650ede09a323/LICENSE

The model catalog downloads the pinned Supertonic graphs and selected voice
styles on demand for local read aloud. These artifacts are not covered by this
project's MIT license; the catalog shows the model license before installation.
No endorsement by Supertone is implied.

## Firefox Translations models and Bergamot WebAssembly runtime

- Work: Firefox Translations release models and Bergamot translator
- Creators: Mozilla, the Bergamot project, and contributors
- Model source: https://mozilla.github.io/translations/firefox-models/
- Runtime source:
  https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/tree/0e9cfbb4fca901314b1b18f871ae23d5adb16c0f/toolkit/components/translations/bergamot-translator
- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
  https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/

The model catalog downloads SHA-256-pinned translation models, vocabularies,
lexicons, JavaScript glue, and the WebAssembly Bergamot runtime on demand.
Translation then runs locally in an isolated worker. These files are not
covered by this project's MIT license. The plugin does not modify the
downloaded source-form JavaScript glue.

## FLEURS multilingual speech fixtures

- Work: FLEURS: Few-shot Learning Evaluation of Universal Representations of
  Speech
- Authors: Alexis Conneau, Min Ma, Simran Khanuja, Yu Zhang, Vera Axelrod,
  Siddharth Dalmia, Jason Riesa, Clara Rivera, and Ankur Bapna
- Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/fleurs
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12446
- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

This project redistributes eight FLEURS validation recordings for multilingual
ASR integration testing. The selected clips are parallel readings of FLEURS
sentence 1577 in Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Japanese,
and Chinese. They were converted from 16 kHz mono floating-point WAV to 16 kHz
mono signed 16-bit PCM WAV; speech content was not intentionally modified.
Exact dataset configuration, row, recording ID, and derived-file SHA-256 are
recorded in `native/tests/fixtures/multilingual.json`. No endorsement by Google,
the FLEURS authors, or dataset contributors is implied.

## WeSpeaker speaker-embedding model

- Work: `wespeaker_en_voxceleb_resnet34_LM`
- Project: WeSpeaker

The model was trained on the VoxCeleb2 Dev dataset and follows that dataset's
CC BY 4.0 license, as documented by WeSpeaker. This project redistributes the
model in ONNX form, embeds it in the sidecar executable, and supplies a
compatible Rust filterbank frontend. The learned weights were not intentionally
modified. No endorsement by WeSpeaker, the VoxCeleb authors, or dataset
contributors is implied. The model is provided without warranties.

## pyannote speaker-segmentation model

- ONNX export:
  https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/speaker-segmentation-models
- License: MIT

The model was exported to ONNX by the sherpa-onnx project and is embedded in the
sidecar executable.
